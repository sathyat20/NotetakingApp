## What Worked Well
Difficult to say what worked well as I had multiple problems every step of the way. I had the input bar up and running pretty quickly which was a consolation.

## What Didn't
Too many to detail here but the firebase stuff was somehow really difficult to get up and running. I did manage to resolve the bugs eventually after realising some of my firebase methods were not set up properly.
